# Network_Intrusion_Detection_System
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive system that collects network packets and prepares them for compatibility with the model for making predictions. By utilizing the capabilities of different machine learning algorithms such as SVM, RandomForest, DecisionTree, LogisticRegression, and others, this system achieves precise predictions by analyzing the real-time packets that are captured..
